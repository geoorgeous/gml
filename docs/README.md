# GML | George's Math Library

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0b-blue.svg?maxAge=2592000)

GML is a mathematics library to make 3D graphics programming easier. The library currently has full Vector, Matrix, and Quaternion mathematics implemented, with much of the API designed with 3D graphics in mind. There are other 3D graphics libraries out there, such as [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html), but this one is mine!

GML is being written to solidify my personal understanding in 3D mathematics and to assist me in writing 3D graphics applications. Though this is a pet project of mine I am developing and managing this library with the idea that others might use it. It's important to me that GML is relatively light-weight, performant, has a well documented API, and is easy and intuitive to use.

GML is currently in beta until I'm confident enough for the final release. Before the final release GML will be fully documented (via doxygen).
