# GML | George's Math Library

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1a-blue.svg?maxAge=2592000)

GML is being written to solidify my personal understanding in 3D mathematics and to assist me in writing 3D graphics applications. Though this is a pet project of mine I am developing and managing this library with the idea that others might use it.

[View documentation](https://george-mcdonagh.github.io/gml/documentation/html/).

It's important to me that GML is well-documented, relatively light-weight, performant, has a well documented API, and is intuitive to use.
