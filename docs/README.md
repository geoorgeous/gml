# GML | George's Math Library

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1a-blue.svg?maxAge=2592000)

GML is being written to solidify my personal understanding in 3D mathematics and to assist me in writing 3D graphics applications. Though this is a pet project of mine I am developing and managing this library with the idea that others might use it.

It's important to me that GML is well-documented, relatively light-weight, performant, has a well documented API, and is intuitive to use.

## Features

Though some features may be marked as `implemented` they are still subject to updates. `stubbed` features are features that have barely been implemented to a usable level, and `in progress` features are partially implemented, somewhat usable. Features marked as `to-do` have no presence in the latest version at all.

| Feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Vectors | `implemented` |
| Matrices | `implemented` |
| Vector math | `implemented` |
| Matrix math | `implemented` |
| Quaternions | `implemented` |
| Quaternion math | `in progress` |
| Shapes | `stubbed` |
| Shapes - collision | `to-do` |
