# GML | George's Math Library

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0b-blue.svg?maxAge=2592000)

**GML (George's Math Library)** is a mathematics library I've been working on to use in my 3D graphics/game development projects. There are plenty out there such as GLMaths but I thought I'd give it a go to make my own to gather a better understanding behind the maths at work behind real-time 3D graphics applications.

GML is being written to solidify my personal understanding in 3D mathematics and to assist me in writing 3D graphics applications. Though this is a pet project of mine I am developing and managing this library with the idea that others might use it. It's important to me that GML is relatively light-weight, performant, has a well documented API, and is easy and intuitive to use.

_GML and the GML GitHub Wiki are both currently a work in progress. GML 1.0 is currently in beta as the API is very much subject to change. Before I push it in to full release the Wiki will be fully populated and the library documentation will be complete._
